This repository contains Helm charts for installing OpenHands Cloud
in your own Kubernetes cluster. These charts are also used to drive
the official, public version of OpenHands Cloud at
[app.all-hands.dev](https://app.all-hands.dev).

You may also want to check out the MIT-licensed [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands)

Issues in this repository are for the OpenHands Cloud app and
for the Helm charts here. Issues with OpenHands itself should be
opened in the [core OpenHands repository](github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands).
