Please follow SemVer for the OpenHands Helm chart.

- All changes to the Helm chart (templates, values, dependencies, or defaults) MUST be accompanied by a chart version bump in charts/openhands/Chart.yaml.
- Use semantic versioning: MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for new features (backward compatible), PATCH for fixes/docs/refactors that do not change behavior.
